# 🩺 Healthcare Disease Prediction with Explainable AI (SHAP)

## 📌 Overview
Built a diabetes risk prediction system using patient health data with model explainability using SHAP. The model predicts if a patient is likely diabetic and highlights which factors contribute to the prediction.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Early identification of diabetes reduces complications & treatment costs. Hospitals require predictive analytics with transparency to support doctors' decision-making.

## 🧠 ML Workflow
Data Cleaning → Missing Value Fixing → Train-Test Split → Model Training → Evaluation → Explainable AI → Dashboard Insights

## 📊 Model Performance
- Accuracy: ~78%
- Focus on reducing false negatives for medical safety
- Confusion matrix visualization for results analysis

## 🧠 SHAP Explainable AI Results
- Glucose, BMI, Age have highest positive impact on diabetes risk
- SHAP beeswarm plot used to interpret prediction contribution

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard Insights
- Diabetes higher in Age > 50 patients
- Highest risk in Obese & Overweight patients
- KPI cards: Total Patients, Diabetic Patients, Diabetes Rate %
